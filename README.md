# manager_spending
App for manager spending: 
1. Simple example use dabase and bloc pattern to build three simple functions. In this app we can do:
   + Register
   + Login
   + Save data to sqlite
   + Find and show data to listview 
   + Find total and show total.
2. I have some issue:
   + I tried to use autocomplete text field and I can not to put current text when fill data back to text field. 
Finaly I used text field and trying to find the way to solve.
   + When I input data to one table in database, data not changed like android studio. You can see when fist entering one item 
to dabase, and click that item to edit it, but has not id.  So if you click back then return that page, click that item again
to edit, it's work.
